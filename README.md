# signup-form

### Basic sign up form design and functionality.

* User selects a username and password
* Username must contain at least 2 characters - letters or numbers only - will receive an alert if username doesn't match criteria
* Password must contain at least 6 characters - letters or numbers only - will receive an alert if password doesn't match criteria
* User will need to enter in password twice - will receive alert if passwords don't match
* User can then click 'Sign Up' button to submit details
* User will have the option to jump to login page if they already have an account - dummy link as this example is just for the sign up form
